# Detrav Hockey

A simple hockey game for mobile.

This is a demo project that I did to study the network technologies godot, websocket, enet + upnp, webrtc.

Unfortunately, the webrtc protocol that Godot uses couldn’t work with my turn server, so I ended up rewriting everything to websocket so that the game would work on my mobile.
